To implement state management using the Context API in React, you'll need the following components:

Context Provider: The provider component is responsible for defining the context and providing the state and actions to its child components. It wraps the components that need access to the shared state.

Initial State: You need to define the initial state that will be shared across components. This state will be updated and accessed by the components using the context.

State Management Functions: These functions handle the state updates. They can be defined within the context provider or as separate functions passed through the context. These functions are responsible for modifying the state and triggering re-renders in the consuming components.

Context Consumer: The consumer component is used by the components that need access to the shared state. It consumes the context and retrieves the state and actions provided by the context provider.
